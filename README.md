The game is quite simple and really the name says it all: High-Low, Red or Black.

The Dealer plays one card from the deck face up on the table. The Dealer prompts the player to guess whether the next card to be played face up will be higher or lower than the previos card played. 

If the player gets it right, the dealer asks a second question of whether the card is red or black. 

The player wins if they successfully answer both questions. 

If the player loses they must take a drink.

Since each card played remains on the table face-up the Player's accuracy increases as the game continues with deductive reasoning.
